### Thoughts on Scala

I kind of really like Scala? Which is strange because
I don't think I've heard a lot of people use it or
love it as much as other languages, say TypeScript or
Rust or whatever is currently the big language to learn.

It's statically typed, but also feels flexible in casting
to different types and inferring types. It also has lots
of support from libraries, as I was easily able to import
the random library and stdin library. 

I think my favorite language design choice may be type
inferrence.
