### Thoughts on Scala

I kind of really like Scala? Which is strange because
I don't think I've heard a lot of people use it or
love it as much as other languages, say TypeScript or
Rust or whatever is currently the big language to learn.

It's statically typed, but also feels flexible in casting
to different types and inferring types. It also has lots
of support from libraries, as I was easily able to import
the random library and stdin library. 

I think my favorite language design choice may be type
inferrence. I also really like the compile error 
messages, as they're very helpful and descriptive. Same 
for pattern matching! I think the reason the developers 
considered this is to make Scala very flexible in whatever
it's being used for, which is does feel like that.

I think I'd want to explore more Scala libraries. I'd also
want to know more about the functional programming 
aspects of Scala, as I feel like my code was mostly
imperative language.
